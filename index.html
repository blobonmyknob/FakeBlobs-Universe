    /*Internal css from head tag to h3 shown below*/
    
    h3 {
      color : blue;
      font-size: 3rem;
    }
    /* Selector: h3 Property: color and font-size, value: color and size*/

    <!-- inline css -->
    <b>INLINE CSS EXAMPLE</b>
    <h1 style = "color : pink ; font-size : 3rem" > Hello World </h1>
    <p>As you can see, inline CSS is manualy put to a single attribute, in this case it's h1</p>
    <!-- As you can see h1 is the selector and style is the attribute, the property is color and the value to the property is pink-->
    <hr/>
    <!-- Turning this into internal css from head tag -->
    <b>INTERNAL CSS EXAMPLE</b>
    <h3>I am H3 and I am formatted!</h3>
    <h3>I am H3 and I am formatted!</h3>
    <h3>I am H3 and I am formatted!</h3>
    <h2>This is not formatted because it's H2 AND NOT H3</h2>
    <p>Internal CSS is way more powerfull because it can format every same attribute at once</p>
    <!-- As you can see it only formats h3 and not h2 -->
    <hr/>
    <p>For the next lesson we're going to need a new fresh page. This next lesson has to do with external css from another document, that css document will format certain pages for you to maximize productivity.:</p>
