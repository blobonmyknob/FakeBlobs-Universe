      <h3>Meme 1: March 19th 2021</h3>
      <p>Hello, this is the first meme of the week! I hope to be posting lots more of this as time goes by! So, here it is!</p>
      <img width = "430" height = "html" src= "Images/Memes/MOTW Images/MOTW-1.jpg" alt = "4 Things we did as kids for no reason." />
      <p>I found this meme on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/m6hmmv/i_know_everybody_did_atleast_one_of_these/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, I find this one funny just for the fact that it's a semi-relatable one, I call it semi-relatable because the first one is kind of cursed and I'd never do it. Looking at it right now makes my mouth hurt.</p>
